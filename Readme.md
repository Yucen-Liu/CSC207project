PLEASE CHANGE IF I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR STORY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND REMOVED SOMETHING IMPORTANT

1. A user wants to check the weather information of a city, and they should be able to change
   the order the information is displayed in. [Team story]

2. As a user, I want to see detailed weather information (such as simple things like temperature and condition,
   but also more complex things like humidity) for cities/regions of my choice and see a
   history of what cities were recently searched. [Felix’s story]

3. A user wants to look up for the weather information of a major city. The user runs
   the weather information generation program and enters the city name. The detailed
   weather information of that city is displayed. [Mengzhou’s story]

4. As a user, I want to create a favorites list of cities I care about so I can quickly check
   their weather. I’d like to organize the list in my preferred order and view each city’s
   latest temperature, humidity, and precipitation details anytime. [Eric’s story]

5. As a user, I want to view weather information for major cities within a specific region
   and access detailed information for each city. The user selects a large region, which
   displays the general weather conditions for major cities in that area. The user can then
   click on a specific city to view more detailed weather forecasts, including temperature,
   precipitation probability, and wind speed for the coming days. [Yucen’s story]
