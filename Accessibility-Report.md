## Accessibility Report

#### Principles of Universal Design

##### 1. Equitable use

Our program ensures basic accessibility by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) that supports both manual inputs (e.g., typing city names) and button clicks. However, it does not currently address users with visual impairments, motor disabilities, or other specific needs. Future improvements could include screen reader support and voice-based input to better serve users with disabilities.

##### 2. Flexibility in Use

The program allows users to input data using text fields and interact via buttons, offering flexibility for users with different preferences. However, this flexibility is limited to users who can see and physically interact with the GUI. To improve, we could introduce voice commands and adaptive layouts for users who experience difficulty with traditional input methods, addressing the needs highlighted in the slides

#####  3. Simple and Intuitive Use

The program displays weather data using visual labels and text. However, users with visual impairments might find this inaccessible. Adding text-to-speech functionality and ensuring screen reader compatibility would align the program with accessibility best practices and principles.

#####  4. Perceptible Information

Currently, the program handles invalid input by displaying error messages but does not provide suggestions or options to correct mistakes. Implementing features like autocomplete for city names or error recovery options (e.g., undo actions) would reduce the risk of user frustration and meet universal design expectations

##### 5. Tolerance for Error

The interface allows users to input city names, but error handling for invalid inputs is not very intuitive and relies on error messages. Future enhancements could include undo options or automatic correction features, such as suggesting valid city names when the user makes a spelling mistake.

##### 6. Low Physical Effort

The program is designed to minimize physical effort, requiring only simple mouse clicks or keyboard inputs. However, users with mobility impairments might still face challenges. Voice recognition could be implemented to better support users with these needs

##### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use

The current layout is compact and suitable for most screen sizes, but it may not work well for users with screen magnifiers or on mobile devices. Adding responsive design features and customization options for text and button sizes could ensure better usability across all devices



#### Target Market

This program is primarily targeted at users who need real-time weather information, such as travelers, students, and professionals who plan their daily activities based on weather conditions. Additionally, features like "Manage Cities" cater to users who frequently monitor multiple locations, such as remote workers or outdoor enthusiasts. By implementing accessibility improvements, the program could also appeal to a broader audience, including users with disabilities.



#### Accessibility Barriers for Certain Demographics

The program, in its current state, may not be fully accessible to individuals with disabilities, such as visual, motor, or cognitive impairments. For example, users with visual impairments might struggle due to the lack of screen reader support, while users with limited motor control might find it difficult to interact using a mouse or keyboard. These issues reflect the limitations outlined in the social model of disability, which emphasizes the role of environmental design in accessibility barriers. By addressing these shortcomings, we can reduce both tangible and relational harms, as discussed in the lectures
